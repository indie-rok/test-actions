In the last few years, GitHub Actions have become a productivity hack for DevOps engineers, allowing them to automate deployments, code execution, and more. However, it also introduced new attack vectors into a codebase that, if not detected, could lead to potential security threats.

Let's compare these two GitHub Actions, which at first sight, perform the same thing but with a few key differences, providing more robust security. Strategies like limiting the GitHub workflow permission access (only to `contents: read`{:.yml}), using a specific commit hash when using third-party dependencies (to avoid injecting new vulnerabilities in newer versions), and [avoiding storing $GITHUB_TOKEN in generated artifacts](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/github-repo-artifacts-leak-tokens/) (with `persist-credentials: false`{:.yml}).

Finally, while it's important to know what these security threats look like, you can also use a tool like [Zizmor](https://github.com/woodruffw/zizmor) to help you detect them (especially in larger codebases).
